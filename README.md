# Dog-Breed-Classification-using-CNN-based-classifier
AI-powered dog breed classification system built for a Master’s capstone project. Utilizes deep learning and transfer learning with CNNs (MobileNetV2, ResNet50) to classify 120 dog breeds from images. Trained on Kaggle dataset and deployed using Streamlit for real-time predictions.
